      <p id="desc"><strong>Kare Kare</strong> is a traditional Filipino stew 
        complimented with a thick savory peanut sauce. The commonly used meats 
        for this dish are ox tail, tripe, and pork leg; on some occasions goat 
        and chicken meat are also used. Besides the peanuts, this dish depends 
        on the shrimp paste (on the side) in order to be fully enjoyed. 
        Traditionally, “palayok” (clay cooking pot) is used to cook this dish 
        and it is also used as the serving pot.</p>
